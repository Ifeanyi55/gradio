# Introduction
The goal of `gradio-in-r` is to demonstrate how to port the gradio Python module into R and build fully-functional gradio applications. 
This is the project idea of [@IfeanyiIdiaye](https://github.com/Ifeanyi55). You can learn more at this [repo](https://github.com/Ifeanyi55/Gradio-in-R)

# Install Reticulate
To be able to use gradio in R, it is necessary to have the [reticulate](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/) R package installed first. 

This package interfaces between R and Python and, therefore, makes it possible to install and import Python modules in R.

Install reticulate by running the following line of code in your R console: `install.packages("reticulate")`.

# Install & Import Gradio
To install and import gradio, run the lines of code:

```
library(reticulate) # load reticulate

py_install("gradio", pip = TRUE) # install gradio with pip

gr <- import("gradio") # import gradio as gr
```

# Building a Gradio Application
With gradio installed and imported, we now have access to gradio's app building methods. 

Let's build a simple app for an R function that returns a greeting

```
greeting <- \(name) paste("Hello", name)

app <- gr$Interface(
  fn = greeting,
  inputs = gr$Text(label = "Name"),
  outputs = gr$Text(label = "Greeting"),
  title = "Hello! &#128515 &#128075"
)

app$launch(server_name = "localhost", 
           server_port = as.integer(3000))
```
You can see more examples [here](https://github.com/Ifeanyi55/Gradio-in-R/tree/main/Code), including using blocks to build a machine learning application.
